Ceylon code is released on [GitHub](http://github.com/ceylon). We're working as hard as we can to get the first milestone into your hands. Adventurous? [check out the code](/code).

The first milestone will have:

* a command-line compiler for Ceylon which implements a *subset* of the 
  language described in the language specification,
* a full-featured Eclipse plugin built around the compiler's type analyzer,
  and
* the first draft of the language module, which includes the basic types
  mentioned in the language specification.

You can follow our progress on:

* our [blog](/blog), or
* the [roadmap](/documentation/roadmap).
